# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Makayla!

### ðŸŽ“ Sophmore at UC Santa Cruz Studying Applied Mathematics and Computer Science

### ðŸ”­ Aspiring Data Scientist and Machine Learning Enthusiast

I recently earned a Machine Learning Foundations certification from Cornell Tech, which I am actively using as an AI Studio Fellow at Automation Anywhere. My current work focuses on developing an object detection model to identify elements like signatures and stamps in documents, showcasing my interest in bridging cutting-edge technology with real-world challenges.

Beyond my academic and professional pursuits, I am deeply curious about how AI and Machine Learning can transform fields like childhood education, and I am eager to explore impactful solutions in this space.

## ðŸŽ¯ Featured Project: Signature Detection Using Computer Vision for Automation Anywhere
**What We Did:** Preprocessed and combined annotation files for over 2000 images, created Detectron2 and Yolov8 models to locate signatures, created Streamlit application for users to test out both models and locate signatures with any image.  <br />
**Tools:** Python, PyTorch, Detectron2, Yolov8  <br />
**Applications:** VSCode, Jupyter Notebooks, Google Colab, Streamlit  <br />
**Results:** 81% accuracy for Detectron2, both models able to detect lack of signatures  <br />
**Curious?** See the full project [here](https://github.com/savannahgong/Automation-Anywhere-1A)
