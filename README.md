# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Makayla!

### ðŸŽ“ Sophmore at UC Santa Cruz Studying Applied Mathematics and Computer Science

### ðŸ”­ Aspiring Data Scientist and Machine Learning and Sustainability Enthusiast

I love tackling real-world problems through data analysis and predictive modeling. Iâ€™m big on continuously learning and building my skills, and believe taking initiative is key to growth. (Ask me about growing my technical skills and leadership as a Break Through Tech FellowLinks to an external site.!) Currently, I'm focusing on building machine learning models and diving deeper into data science. Iâ€™m looking to leverage and grow my skills in an internship where I can contribute to exciting projects and learn from industry professionals- got any leads? Let me know!

## ðŸŽ¯ Featured Project: Signature Detection Using Computer Vision for Automation Anywhere
**What We Did:** Preprocessed and combined annotation files for over 2000 images, created Detectron2 and Yolov8 models to locate signatures, created Streamlit application for users to test out both models and locate signatures with any image.  <br />
**Tools:** Python, PyTorch, Detectron2, Yolov8  <br />
**Applications:** VSCode, Jupyter Notebooks, Google Colab, Streamlit  <br />
**Results:** 81% accuracy for Detectron2, both models able to detect lack of signatures  <br />
**Curious?** See the full project repo in my pinned.  <br />

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack:
**Languages:** Python, Java, C++  <br />
**Libraries & Frameworks:** scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, spaCy, pytorch <br />
**Tools:** Jupyter Notebooks, Google Colab, Git, GitHub  <br />

## ðŸš€ Projects:
A few other noteworthy projects Iâ€™ve worked on:  <br />  <br />

MovieHub - Personalized Movie Recommender  <br />
Links to an external site.Developed a recommendation engine using collaborative filtering to suggest movies based on user preferences.  <br />
Tech Stack: Python, Flask, Scikit-learn  <br />
Learnings: Building recommendation systems and deploying applications  <br />
