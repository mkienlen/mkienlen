# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Makayla!

### ðŸŽ“ Sophmore at UC Santa Cruz Studying Applied Mathematics and Computer Science
### ðŸ”­ Aspiring Data Scientist and Machine Learning and Sustainability Enthusiast
I love tackling real-world problems through data analysis and predictive modeling. Iâ€™m big on continuously learning and building my skills, and believe taking initiative is key to growth. (Ask me about growing my technical skills and leadership as a Break Through Tech FellowLinks to an external site.!) Currently, I'm focusing on building machine learning models and diving deeper into data science. Iâ€™m looking to leverage and grow my skills in an internship where I can contribute to exciting projects and learn from industry professionals- got any leads? Let me know!

## ðŸŽ¯ Featured Project: Signature Detection Using Computer Vision for Automation Anywhere
What We Did: Preprocessed and combined annotation files for over 2000 images, created Detectron2 and Yolov8 models to locate signatures, created Streamlit application for users to test out both models and locate signatures with any image.
Tools: Python, PyTorch, Detectron2, Yolov8
Applications: VSCode, Jupyter Notebooks, Google Colab, Streamlit
Result: 81% accuracy for Detectron2, both models able to detect lack of signatures
Curious? See the full project repo in my pinned.

## âœ¨ Fun Fact:
A matcha latte is my favorite accessory, and you can find me with it when coding to my favorite Lo-Fi playlist, engaging in fun-yet-charged discussion on AI ethics with my Women in Tech group, or decompressing with a TikTok scroll.
